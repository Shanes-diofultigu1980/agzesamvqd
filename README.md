Just walked out of the theater and, oh boy, what was that fever dream I just experienced? You know that feeling when you unwrap a candy that's been in your pocket just a bit too long, and it's all sticky and you don’t know if it’s worth eating? That was like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Snow White tonight.

The visuals. I mean, I get it, technology is supposed to dazzle us but, yikes, at times it felt like being trapped in a kaleidoscope while someone pelted me with glitter. Maybe that's the 𝘮𝘰𝘥ern remix of enchanting? I swear, the dwarfs had like, superpowers now? What's next, Dopey shooting laser beams out of his eyes? I mean, yeah, I was tired when I went in, but come on.

> Somewhere in the middle of some nonsensical forest scene (I think trees were singing? Or was that my brain short-circuiting due to high sugar levels from overpriced popcorn?), a wild surge of “where the heck is this going” hit me. The plot seemed to bounce around like a hyperactive puppy on energy drinks. And speaking of Snow—what's with all the lingering shots on her wide, doe-like eyes? Made me feel like a deer caught in headlights.

And the Evil Queen, oh wow. She’s got some major drama queen vibes, not the evil kind though. Maybe she was more misunderstood than just plain evil? Someone needs to write her a sad love song playlist or something. And for real, the mirror has the attitude of that one snarky friend we all have: brutally honest but you kinda love it?

```
bool IsFairest(string name) {
    return name == Snow White ? true : false;
}
```

On a scale of 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   to man, just actually go and 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , I’d say, if you're up for a wild ride and maybe some existential pondering about the evolution of fairy tales, it’s worth the weirdness. But if you've ventured into some of those 𝘰𝘯𝘭𝘪𝘯𝘦 forums and   trailers hyped this up like the next awesome sauce, well, manage those expectations, buddy. Like trying to catch Snow White's pigeons blindfolded on a too-spinning carousel.
